            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the Eaſe the obdurate gain, by being delivered from the Remorſe and Regrets, the Reproaches, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Conſcience, is far over-ballanced by the Loſs that cannot be divided from it; Namely, the Loſs of the Joys of Innocence, and of the Senſe of God's Favour, and Hopes of a happy Futurity. There's not an eminent Man among the Grecians (ſaith one of the Ancients) that dies an Heathen, or an Infidel, though they lived ſo. If there be <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in <hi>company,</hi> there are <hi>none</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>alone.</hi> They tremble at that in private, and at Death, which they laugh at among the Jovial Crew.

            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> abridges us of nothing but ſin, which is Rank poiſon to our Souls: and exchanges the momentary Pleaſures of it, for the perpetual peace of a good Conſcience.

If the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, be worth the venturing endleſs Torments; and if the number of ſinners that run ſo great a hazard, are well ſatisfied in their minds, that it will moderate all their <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> to remember what they have <hi>enjoy'd;</hi> That <hi>Hell</hi> is not ſo <hi>hot,</hi> nor ſo <hi>laſting,</hi> as to keep them out of it; and to be preferr'd before the <hi>neceſſary means of their prevention,</hi>

               <p>O their cruel Hard-heartedneſs, that will rather ſuffer the Temple of God to be ruined, than ſupported by neceſſary Portions. It ſhall be e'er-long upbraided to them by their Judge, that himſelf was hungry, and they gave him no meat, who gave his Body and Blood to feed them, and quench their Thirſt: Denied a Rag to cover his Nakedneſs, who would have cloathed their Souls with the Robe of his Righteouſneſs, that they might not be naked <hi>in that Day.</hi> This is it he takes ſo tenderly, that his Brethren, for whom he died, whom he lodges in his Boſome, the Partners of his Spirit, and Coheirs of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, ſhould be denied Relief, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go away aſhamed, unpitied.

                  <p>How many, without the Advantages of the Goſpel, have thought it mean, and effeminate to lament, or be dejecteed in pain?

Look for Evils every day, and caſt all your Cares, and Fears upon God. Let your Carriage be ſuch all the Day, as thoſe that muſt appear before him at Night. In all Difficulties aſcend to him for Counſel and Direction, in all Troubles for Support, in all your Undertakings for a Bleſſing. Be ſtill asking, whoſe am I? what do I here? am
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150275:86"/>I in my way? Is this my laſt Day, or do I look for another?</p>
               <p>Entertain not vain Deſires, or worldly Luſts, but reſiſt, reject them; Turn and fix your Thoughts upon ſomething that is good: frequently lift up your Souls to God in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Praiſes and Supplications.</p>
               <p>Make a Covenant with your <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear,</hi> the Inlets of Luſt and Vanity. Set the Lord always before you. Do nothing that may Create ſorrow at Night, or Confuſion at the great Day. Reſolve to ſpend the day as uſefully as poſſible; to God, others, your ſelf; to ſpeak for God and his Glory, what ever it coſt you; not to be terrified from, or aſhamed of him, or his Service; ſo as the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience may be ground of your Rejoycing. Your Heavenly work is to run a Race, to fight a good fight, to ſtrive, and wreſtle; which cannot be done, without giving all Diligence, Care, and Watchfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Follow your Earthly Imployment, though Difficult, with Chearfulneſs and a Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mind. Be Induſtrious in your Buſineſs, and Honeſt in your Dealings: Take no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of any overſight; work not upon the Ignorance, Unskilfulneſs, Weakneſs, or Neceſſity of others: Do as you would have done, to your ſelves, or yours. It's better to ſuffer wrong, than do it. Uſe not <hi>many
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150275:86"/>words,</hi> and thoſe underſtood by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor: All the Buſineſs of a Bargain is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in a <hi>few:</hi> He that ſpeaks leaſt, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally means faireſt: and, He that deceives, by ſpeaking what is true, in a ſence not intended or underſtood by the other, is a Liar and a Thief. Avoid, not only what is <hi>falſe,</hi> but that alſo which <hi>deceives;</hi> all Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating, Intricate, Crafty ſpeeches; ſpeak the ſence of your Mind; a Bargain may be as unmerciful, as a Robbery; God ſtill takes the weakeſt part, and will Reckon with them who Injure the unable to Reſiſt: no man makes an unjuſt gain, without a certain loſs: He can never do, or fare well, who thinks there can be more profit in any thing, than in obeying God. <hi>Let no man go beyond to defraud his Brother in any matter, becauſe the Lord is the Avenger of all ſuch

               <p>Let your <hi>Meals</hi> be with Thankfulneſs, Temperance, Sobriety; ſo as not to Disfit, but Inable you for the Imployments of your Body and Mind.

Forget not to Pray, and give

Work a Through Change in my whole Soul; Inlighten

Turn away mine Eyes from beholding Vanity. Set a watch, O Lord, before my Mouth, and keep the Door of my Lips, that I offend not with my Tongue: Let me delight in that which is Good, eſchew and abhor that which is Evil; ſet thee always before me, that I may not dare to Sin againſt Thee. Make me peaceable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in my ſelf, uſeful and beneficial to others, well-pleaſing and acceptable unto Thee. Mind me frequently of my latter end; while I live let me live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, when I die let me die unto thee, living and dying let me be thine. Be very merciful to all Mankind, eſpecially thoſe that are called Chriſtians: Inlarge

                  <head>Morning Prayer, on the Lord's Day.</head>
                  <p>MOſt Holy and Infinitely glorious Lord God. Thou art greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of thy Saints, and to be had in Reverence by all that draw nigh unto Thee. It's an Infinite Condeſcention in thy Majeſty, to ſuffer ſuch a deſpicable Worm as I am, to come before Thee, to wait upon Thee, to ſpeak unto Thee, to have any thing to do with Thee in a way of Grace and Mercy. Had'ſt thou dealt with me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Deſerts, and Rewarded
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:150275:94"/>me after mine Iniquities, I had been long ago in that place of Torment where Prayer, and the means of Grace could do me no good at all. O Pardon my abuſe of thy Mercies, miſpending my Time, Prophaning thy Sabbaths, Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thine Ordinances, the unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns I have made unto Thee for all thy Benefits, which might juſtly cauſe thee to withdraw thy ſelf from me, and thy Bleſſing from thine Ordinances. Make me truly ſenſible of the worth of the Opportunity thou this Day puts into my hand for the good of my Immortal Soul; let it not be as a prize put into the hand of a Fool, that hath no heart to uſe it: Help me to make a wiſe, a right Improvement of the ſame, for the Glory of Thy Name, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring my ſelf for my <hi>Eternal Reſt;</hi> Let my Thoughts this Day be much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and upon that wonderful love in my Redemption. Take away my Heart of Stone, that's ſo inſenſible of my own Vileneſs and thy abundant Goodneſs, and give me a Heart of Fleſh; write thy Laws upon it, put thy Fear within me,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:150275:95"/>that I may never depart from Thee. Let not thy Sabbaths, nor thine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances be continued in vain unto me; but let me grow in Grace under all the means of Grace I enjoy. The older I grow, the better let me be; the nearer I come to my end, let me be the fitter for thy ſelf. Let me love the Habitation of thy Houſe, and the place where thine Honour Dwelleth; and Eſteem one Day in thy Courts, better than a Thouſand elſewhere: and that I had rather be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of my God, than to dwell in the Tents of Wickedneſs. Let it be my Meat and Drink, the Joy and Rejoycing of my Soul, to do thy Will, and to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in thy Service. Viſit the dark Corners of the Earth with the light of thy glorious Goſpel, and let all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it walk worthy of it. Make our Soveraign, and all our Superiors, thy faithful Subjects, and Servants. Let thy Prieſts be Cloathed with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thy Saints ſhout for Joy. Be in all our Solemn Aſſemblies; Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany thine own Inſtitutions with thine

Be with me this Day, let my Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Sin Increaſe my Hatred againſt it, my Praiſes and Thankſgivings be the Inward ſenſe of my Soul: Let my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Heavenly things, have an Influence upon me, for the bettering of me. Go along with me into the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of thy Servants; unite and compoſe my Thoughts in thy Preſence, let me attend upon thee without Diſtraction. Let me Conſider, thou haſt an Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me at all Times, eſpecially when I draw nigh unto Thee in the way of thy Worſhip. Let me Pray unto Thee in Spirit and Truth, becauſe thou art a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and requireſt ſo to be worſhipped. Give me a Hearing Ear, a ſeeing Eye, an underſtanding Heart.

                  <p>MOſt great and Infinitely glorious Lord God, who haſt Exalted thy ſelf far above the Heavens, and above the Praiſes, and Apprehenſions of the beſt of thy Creatures.

But what ſhall I render unto thee for thy unſpeakable goodneſs to Mankind, not only in making us

Let me live the Sermons that I hear, the Ordinances I enjoy, the Duties I am Imployed in. Let my Thoughts be much upon that Happy ſtate, where I ſhall offend thee and my ſelf no more; but Reap my Redeemer's Purchaſe for thoſe that ſincerely ſerve Thee. Look in much Mercy upon all Mankind; Say, Behold me, Behold me, to the People that have not known thee,

Forgive the crying Sins of theſe Three Nations, turn us unto thee by a ſpeedy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance and Reformation, that Iniquity may not be our Ruine. Compoſe our Differences, make up our Breaches, heal our Diviſions. Endue our Severaign with all neceſſary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for his preſent and future Happineſs. Let none of our Magiſtrates bear the Sword in vain, but, be faithful to that Truſt committed to them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move not thy Candleſtick; let not our Teachers be driven into Corners; let their Doctrine be pure, and their Lives exemplary for the good of Souls; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their Endeavours with thy Bleſſing. Bring unto my Remembrance that part of thy Word I have Read or Heard this Day; let me hide it in my heart, that I may not dare to Sin againſt thee. As I am one day nearer my End, let me be ſo much nearer keeping an

Thou mayeſt juſtly inflict upon me all the Curſes that are writ in thy Law, and give me my Portion with Hypocrites and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But there is Mercy with thee that thou mayeſt be feared, that my Sins may be pardoned, and my Soul ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thou haſt exalted thy Son to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Remiſſion of Sins.

O for his ſake pardon all mine Iniquities, accept of me graciouſly, and love me freely; look fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably upon me, be mercifull unto me, as thou uſeſt to do unto thoſe that love and fear thy Name. Receive me into thy favour. Give me an unfeigned Conſent, and the neceſſary Conditions of my Right to that Covenant, which I am going to have ſealed unto me by thee.

                     <hi>Review daily your Heart and Life by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Scrutiny.</hi> Summon your ſelf before the Bar of Conſcience; <hi>Reckon</hi> for your Thoughts, Inclinations, Paſſions, Words, and Actions; your behaviour in your ſeveral Duties, Places, Relations. Take a ſtrict Account of the miſcarriages of the Day, what Sins of Omiſſion, or Commiſſion you have been guilty of; and Confeſs them to God with an hearty ſorrow and ſhame, and a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of your ſelf; and firmly Reſolve by his Grace and Aſſiſtance never to be guilty of the like again; but to lead a new life. A ſpeedy, preſent, and particular Repentance, is the way to keep your accounts even, and to leave as little as may be upon the ſcore to Trouble you when you are leaſt able to bear it, and have moſt need of Comfort; and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150275:118"/>likelier to wipe out the guilt of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sins, than a general Repentance on a Death-Bed, when you cannot but forget, and omit many things which you can take no diſtinct notice of. 'Tis too much Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for any man to Conclude that his Sins will be forgiven him in a lump, and that a general Confeſſion, and Acknowledgment of them will ſuffice when he comes to Dye. Let no leſs Humiliation, Repentance and Faith ſerve for the leaſt Sin, than you have good ground to conclude will carry you bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from your Knees through Death to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus get your Caſe rightly ſtated, by leting Conſcience have the full hearing of it in her private Seſſions, before you appear at the great Aſſize. Make your <hi>Bed</hi> the Memorial of your <hi>Grave,</hi> and your <hi>Evening Thoughts</hi> an Image of <hi>the Day of Judgment;</hi> than which there's no greater Inſtrument of Piety and Virtue in the world: This will make us aſhamed, and afraid to neglect our Duty, to commit any Sin, when we know we muſt be accountable to our ſelves for it at Night, and to God at the laſt Day. By this means we ſhall be able to Correct the Errors of our paſt Lives, to walk by a ſure and ſteady Rule, to make our Repentance particular, to prevent Sin coming on us with an After-clap; <hi>for, if we would Judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged</hi>

Think, what a terrible thing this will be to the drowzy World; what a Surprize to the Careleſs and Ungodly; to be thus ſuddainly overtaken, not knowing what to do, or which way to turn: The trembling multitude running up
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:150275:119"/>and down, appaled, aſtoniſhed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; in ſo much deſpair of the abuſed mercy of God, that inſtead of ſupplicating it, they'll call to the Rocks and Mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of him that ſits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; and find them as inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable as God himſelf. O the ghaſtly looks, the ſhivering motions, the diſtorted eyes, and liſtning ears, the diſtracted faces, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hands, of the confident and daring ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, at that great and terrible Day; when all the charming Companions and Aſſociates ſhall like enraged Furies fly upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Fewel men feed their Luſts with, ſhall be turned into Fewel for Hell-fire, and ſtings of Conſcience. <hi>When every Vice ſhall have its proper Torment:</hi> The <hi>ſecure Sinner,</hi> be fill'd with Remorſe and Anguiſh: The <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualiſt</hi> tormented with an inſatiable Hunger and Thirſt, when a vexatious Fire ſhall burn Body and Soul. <hi>The tenacious greedy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> periſh with want.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150275:119"/>up into dolefull Howlings, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gripes. How will the <hi>ſenſual Sinner</hi> then look, when all his Terrene Pleaſures ſhall be ſnatched away by thoſe mercileſs Flames? What will the <hi>Voluptuous Glutton</hi> do, when he ſhall ſee all his curious delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dainties, with which he ſo gratified his brutiſh Palate, turn'd to Aſhes? Then they would fain vomit up their delicious morſels; and abhor the remembrance of, what they cannot forget. They confeſs and bewaile their former Folly: The things they eagerly purſued, they ſadly lament, when all their Enjoyments are ſpent, and nothing left but naked Sin, and Conſcience. Where will the <hi>Coſtive Avaricious Earth-worm</hi> delve or ſcrape for Riches; <hi>the Ambitious</hi> Climb for Honour, when they ſee all Gold and Silver, Crown, and Scepter, burnt up? How ſoon then will <hi>Men's fond Preſumptions,</hi> and <hi>Self-flatteries,</hi> vaniſh into ſmoak, and vapour, end in dreadfull deſpair; when all ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their own likeneſs, nakedly, as they are, and there can be no varniſhing, or gilding over a rotten Heart? When none ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God, as they did men, with a diſguiſe of Piety. No Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing, ſteal on his Right-hand. With what Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and impotent Rage will they ſtruggle? What would they not give, to change their place, that they might change their doom?
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:150275:120"/>How will men's borrowed Colours be then melted away? What a number of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Vizards, and diſguiſed Masks of falſe Hearts, be thrown into the Fire? What would <hi>the Man invited to the Marriage-Feaſt,</hi> give for <hi>a Wedding</hi> Garment, when he ſtands at the Door, and receives a Repulſe?

When Rivers of Tears cannot waſh away the Guilt of Conſcience, nor ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl, allay the Rage and Clamour of it. But, Chriſt's Followers ſhall be no loſers.

Make me always ſenſible of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of my Life; and of the ſuddainneſs and certainty of that Day, when thou wilt bring every work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil. Lead me in thy way; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, and ſupport me by thy Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, now, and all my Days. Bind up my Soul in the Bundle of Life. Redeem me from Sin, and Death, and the Power of the Grave; and bring me to thine ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom. Let not any Neglect, Temptation, Pain, or Paſſion, diſcompoſe my Thoughts, or Duty, or hinder me from a well-grounded Confidence in thee. Let neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:150275:124"/>nor things preſent, nor things to come, ſeparate me from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who hath taught me, when I pray, to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
